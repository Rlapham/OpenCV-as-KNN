# OpenCV-as-KNN

As an implementation of KNN, I wanted to set OpenCV's facial recognition coordinates as the query points. After experimenting with Sam Levine's video library VidPy, I first tried applying this to a video clip by accessing the pixel data as a nested for loop, where the KNN categories would change with every frame. I took a step back to better understand the process and settled on working with images. I'm going to open a github issue with cv2 after George Harrison wasn't recognized.
